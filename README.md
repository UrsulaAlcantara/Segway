# L2 INFO232 Mini-project Solve Xporters traffic volume problem

### Context

    As a young and disruptive entrepreuneur, you have just acquired a small lemonade stand located next to an highway. The previous owner of the stand told you: "I noticed that, on average, 1 car out of 100 stops at my stand".
    Hopefully, during the last years, he also kept track of the hourly number cars that used this highway, and he gladly accepted to give you his precious records.
    Since lemons rot fast and you want to avoid waste, you would like to use this data to train a model that predicts the traffic volume. You also found the hourly meteo records of the last years.
    Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to predict the number of cars that will pass by at a given date, hour, and additional meteorological informations.
    The dataset contains 59 features and the solution is the number of cars registred in an hour ranging from 0 to 7280.
